Hello fellow minecrafters
This code was written by a russian hacker. Use at own peril.

Server code is the code that is used to run the server.

## To install
the server, run these commands with a console in the folder you wish to run Minecraft
1. if you have git use this `git clone "https://github.com/X-com/Backup-System.git" server`
   if you don't have git download and extract this file. "https://github.com/X-com/Backup-System/archive/server.zip"
2. `npm install`
3. `npm install -g ts-node`

## To run
the server type:
`ts-node src -p3000` for survival
`ts-node src -p3001` for creative
`ts-node src -p3002` for survival copy

Client code is [hosted on this github](https://x-com.github.io/Backup-System/),
you only need to use it to login to a server of your choice with a specific IP and port.
Note that the port isn't the same as the port you play Minecraft on.
